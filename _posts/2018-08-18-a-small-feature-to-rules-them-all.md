If you were using the application to practice the different Thai font, it was a bit hard because to change the font you had to go in the settings each time to switch between the normal font and the hard one you were learning.

So this is why I've added a new button on top of the card to switch directly between the selected font and the normal font. 

So when you are like ... What's that letter !! Switch back to normal mode quickly in one click and switch it back to you hard one in another click.

Hope it will be useful for most of you.
