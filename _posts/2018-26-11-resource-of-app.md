You can download the sounds here : 

[https://1drv.ms/u/s!ApTSxABBsIcZgpUQcMPZoE6y6yZN2Q](https://1drv.ms/u/s!ApTSxABBsIcZgpUQcMPZoE6y6yZN2Q "https://1drv.ms/u/s!ApTSxABBsIcZgpUQcMPZoE6y6yZN2Q")

It's a folder containing the sentences, words, consonants, vowels and numbers from the app. 

You can so listen to them everywhere you want ;) 

Enjoy!
