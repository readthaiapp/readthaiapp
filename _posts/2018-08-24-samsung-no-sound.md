If you don't have any **sound** in the app and you have a **samsung phone**, follow this steps to change the Text-To-Speech from Samsung to the Google one.

Unfortunately, Samsung have made their own Text-To-Speech system but without the Thai language in it. Thankfully, all Android phone have the **Google Text-To-Speech** pre-installed which have the Thai language.

Also, if you want to switch from a female voice to a male voice, follow the same procedure (It will works for every **Android** phone)

1. Go to your **Settings** and Select **Accessibility**
