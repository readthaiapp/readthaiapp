Hi Thai learner! 

Today in preview, the next development revealed for you. 

## Daily Sentences

A new mode for the sentences part of the application which will help your learning process. 

The super algorithm behind the scene is going to propose you a number of sentences to review each day to become a fluent Thai speakers (or at least better than before ^^). 

Try to review everyday to unlock the prestigious 30 days in a row and discover the surprise behind it. 

## Achievements

This is the perfect time to introduce the achievement system! 

A small gamification of the app to add some fun during your time in the application. 

Collect all the achievements to become a rock super star of Thai, and redeem some exclusive title and joy that you can share with everyone. 

## What's next

I got many reviews that the application is a bit too hard for beginner... and so that's why I'm going to focus more on them on the next releases. 

What I'm going to add for beginner:

* A new mode to learn the consonant / vowel
* Quizz for consonant / vowel

For intermediate: 

* Chat with May (A super intelligent bot ^^) 

**Follow us on the social media to know when the release will be out!**
