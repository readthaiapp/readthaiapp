A **user** had a really good idea for a small feature which can be really useful, a way to access to your previous lesson (from the daily exercise). 

So here it is, now you can access to your old lesson also ( if you go to "**Daily exercise**" then just under **"Back home"** or **"Edit my settings"** you'll see now a **"Previous lesson"** section with all the lesson you have made). 

On top of that, I fixed some design issues on Android mainly, and add a way to keep your screen awake in the carousel mode (That was annoying ;) ) 

And last but not least, a new set of **200 hundred sentences** !

Now, the app have a total of **735 sentences** and **1318** **uniques words**. 

**Reviews, feedback, remarks, etc helps a lot to develop the app, feel free to contact us !!**
