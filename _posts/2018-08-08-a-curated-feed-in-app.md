  What about a curated content from all the social media inside the app
  ?
---

There is a lot of very nice ressource made by people to teach Thai language available on Youtube, Instagram, Twitter, etc...

I'm quite sure that you've already shared one of those video to a friend... "Hey look at that video it explains super well the consonant in Thai"

## The idea

So yeah, that's the main idea, no more to say ^^

I'm watching a lot of Youtube video, and follow instagram feed which help me in my regular basis to learn some new stuff.

That's why I would like to be able to find those kind of video quite easily and fast inside the application.

The list will be managed by me mainly, but wait wait ... soon there will be an account feature, so you'll be able to create your account and actively participate to the content of Read Write Speak Thai.

Also, I understand that some people are creating those content to promote their service (Teacher, School, etc), That's why I'm also thinking of creating a "**Page**" per **Content Creator**, to promote their service inside the app. It would be interesting as a Thai learner to have access to all those information within the app.

## When?

This is my next development task after the release of the Daily Sentence mode.

It will probably take a month to develop and test before deploying it to the public.

## Can I help ?

**Yes ;)**

Tell me if something like that would interest you! I really need some feedback ... I'm developing this application for me, but also everyone which are interested in learning Thai.

**Yes again!**

Give a review on the store (App store or Android Store) that is **helping A LOT.  
**More users on the app, more is my motivation to continue that project ;)

**Yes three!**

If you have some very good video / ressource that you think should be in that curated list, feel free to send me a message (Facebook, email, form here on the site) with the address.

**Yes FOUR! (ok that's the last one).**

If you are a content creator, and want a page on the app, please contact me, I'll submit to you a small form to get the necessary information to create the page for you. It's all free, no fee or else so don't worry ;)
