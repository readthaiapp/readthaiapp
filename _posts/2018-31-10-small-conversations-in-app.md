description: To help you in your learning, a new type of ressource has been added
  to the app, Conversations, hope you'll like it.

The goal of the app is to provide you, **ressources** and **tools** to practice and improve your Thai. 

We first started with **colorised sentences** (to show the tone easily) plus a set of tools like **Play the sentence**, **Play the word**, **Search in Thai or in English** a set of sentences, **Copy** the sentences to **paste** it somewhere else, **Loop** over and over the sentence to shadow it, etc etc

Then, we added the **Consonants**, **Vowels** and **Numbers** to quickly be able to find one of those symbols which we always forget ;) 

Came later on the **Text-To-Speech** tool to be able to loop/hear the pronunciation of your own sentences. 

A bit after, the **Daily Sentences** which remind you to come back to practice a set of sentences^^

Finally, the last major feature added was the **games** to test yourself on all those ressources ;) 

And now... **Conversations!** Yet another feature/ressource which we hope will help you on your journey to master Thai language. 

**Context** is very important when learning new sentences/languages, with small conversations, we have the chance to show you the context, how the words are used, and small simulation of life that you might use one day.

Right now, there are 10 conversations available but we hope to grow that number for every new releases. 

If you have interesting **conversations** that you want to **share** with everyone, please feel free to send it to us.
