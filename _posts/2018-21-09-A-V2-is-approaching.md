  I'm always looking for the best way to learn languages... which probably
  take a lot of my time instead of really learning the language itself ... but wait
  ! I've found something wonderful

Do you know Lýdia Machová ?

She's a **polyglot** (She speaks 9+ **languages**) and **organize** the Polyglot Gathering, a really cool event inviting a lot of polyglot and they share their experiences!

One of the talk of Lýdia is this one : [The Power of Setting Priorities in Language Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eT7dx52wIC8) that you can watch on YouTube for free where she delivers her "**way**" to **learn language**. (I really recommend you to watch all those videos they are fantastic ;) )

A brief summary of it:

#### There are 4 pillars in Language learning

1. **Fun** (your learning should be fun to keep you motivated)
2. **Quantity** (You should provide enough work to reach your goal)
3. **Frequency** (Frequency is key ... work a bit everyday to train your brain and memory)
4. **System** (We will detail it later)

#### The system: Priorities

She exposes a really nice system which is the following:

For a **chunk of time** (say 2 or 3 months) you set **priority** on 3 **skills** that you are going to focus on. After the first chunk of time, you set new priorities (3 **different** skills, or use all the same skills, or one same and 2 different, whatever ;) )

#### The skills are the following, but I'm sure we can find some others

- Listening
- Reading
- Writing
- Speaking
- Vocabulary
- Pronunciation
- Grammar

So, as an example, for the **first two months**; you select to focus on **Listening**, **pronunciation** and **vocabulary**. That does not mean that you are not going to do some grammar or speaking, but your **main focus** is going to be on those 3 skills.

#### Set SMART goals

Next to the priority, it's important to set SMART goal (**S**pecific - **M**easurable - **A**mbitious - **R**ealistic - **T**ime-bound).

This concept is quite known so I won't develop it; there are a ton of articles written about it (ex : [Article 1](https://www.smartsheet.com/blog/essential-guide-writing-smart-goals) - [Article 2](https://www.yourcoach.be/en/coaching-tools/smart-goal-setting.php) )

## Ok ok cool ... but what's the correlation with the app?

The title ! The v2 is approaching ;)

I currently consider the app as a ressource to learn Thai focusing on **reading, listening, vocabulary and speaking**. It's a material which is created by the team here and proposed to you. I want to evolve to propose you all the skills seen upper and more

#### Where I want to go?

I want the app to be more a "coach-ressource-tool" application where you go everyday to practice or encode what you did or find any ressource that suit you the best for your learning.

I want a flow like the following:

1. Set your **main goal** (ex: Being able to read comic book in **Thai** for the next year)
2. Configure your first chunk of time priorities (**Listening - Reading - Vocabulary)**

Depending on what you've selected as priority, the app is going to propose you **ressource** but also **games** and many other **activities** which will let you work on your **priorities.**

Each action in the app will let you earn point (**Reading x sentences = 15 pts)** to measure your work - but also a "free entry" section (I speak with a Thai friend for 15 min - 50 pts)

A screen will shows you your weekly/monthly effort on learning the language as a kind of tracker, depending on the skill.

#### When?

Well, this blogpost is the premise of the development ... nothing has been developed yet because I'm still in the analyse phases gathering information about technical issues, etc.

I don't have an ETA date yet as this is a side project for me I work on it when I get time.

#### Can I participate ?

I accept any kind of help ;) Your feedback about this blogpost is already something!

Any idea which will improve the next concept, a resource that you create that you think should be in the app, feel free to contact me ^^
