This button will lead you to the carousel screen where **only** the sentence that you have set as "**Favorite**" is going to be displayed. 

There is a difference between a **word** and a **sentence**, and each mode is **separated**. 

So favorite all the sentence that you **love** or are **hard** for you and use this mode to review them.
