The **daily exercise** mode will let you set a goal as number of sentence you want to practice per day (5 - 10 - 15) and will **remind** you (if you want) to come back and practice it. 

Useful to have at least a **5 minutes workout** **everyday** ;) (Which is a minimum you should go for more, I believe in you! ) 

The algorithm behind will take a random sentences between all of the sentences in the app and remember that you already seen it. 

After seen it more than 5 times the same sentences, it will remove it from the list of sentence that the app can propose you, because we assume that you know it now!
