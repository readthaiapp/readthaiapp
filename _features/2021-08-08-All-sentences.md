This **mode** allow you to go through all the sentence in the app! 

**Sentences** are classified into two big "**categories**" 

The first one is the "Category" (I know it sounds weird :p) 

Is it a **Question**? An **expression**, related to **emergencies**, etc ? 

The second "Category" is the source. 

If it come from the **app** or from a **book**. 

Right now, we only have one other source which is the first book of **Manee Mana**, but we want to add more and more source.

If you practice the same deck over and over, and want to pass some slide you've already seen and know, just put the **number** of the last slide you've practiced.
