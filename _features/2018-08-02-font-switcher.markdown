description: Switch between different Thai font to practice the most dificult one.

Reading Thai with the **normal font** will be super easy for you at a specific point ;) (If you **practice** enough).

But then you'll be super confused with all the other fonts.

This is why, the app propose **multiple fonts** (7 right now) which you can select.

Change the font via the **Settings icon** on the **top right,** then use the **switcher icon** (on the top right of the carousel card) to switch back to the **normal font** to compare with what you think it was.
