description: Under each sentences, a word-by-word translations to understand how they
  construct sentences.

Under each sentence, you'll see a list of **word** in **Thai** and **English**.

It's a **word by word** translation. It's useful because you'll be able to understand how the association of word are used to make the meaning of a sentence.

Often, the english translation of a sentence won't match the **Word by Word** ! Try to determine how they come to that translation by applying some logic (It's almost a **game** ;) )
