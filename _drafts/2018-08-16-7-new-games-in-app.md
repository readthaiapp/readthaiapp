  games

Wow Wow Wow ! It has been a crazy week of development to pop this really useful feature in the app! 

Thanks to a feedback from Colin and others, we now have some small Quizz/Puzzle type of games. 

It's quite basic right now, but useful already - more of those games will appear in the app soon ;) 

## Sentences and words games

### Find the correct translations

Read or Listen to the sentences/word and select the correct translations. 

### Sound: What sentence/word is it ? English

Almost the same as the Find the correct translations, but here you only have the sound ;) It's a bit harder !! 

### Sound: What sentence/word is it ? Thai

Same principle as above, but with the Thai version. 

### What tone is it? (Only for word)

Probably the most difficult one ;) The word is written in Thai, and you can also listen to it, and you have to find the correct tone! Take care some words have multiple tones! 

## Contest

Who will be the first one with 100 good answers ? 

Send us a screenshot or post on the page when you reach 100 good answers on a game ;)

I've nothing to offer right now, but you'll probably a gold member if they are gold member one day ^^ so good luck!
