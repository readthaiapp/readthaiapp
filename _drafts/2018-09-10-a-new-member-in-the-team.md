Read Write Speak Thai intend to help intermediate learner to have a user-friendly ressource to practice their Thai reading skill through the colour system of the tone. 

At the same time, we want you to read content which is useful to have a kind of WIN-WIN 

That's why, Piriya is joining me in the team to write meaningful and usable sentences for the real world. 

Piriya is a professional translator English/Thai which has a lot of experiences translating website/documents/etc... Feel free to use the contact form if you need any kind of translations work done by her. 

## Wait that's not all...

I'm a new step further on many new things! 

Soon, a new page on the website to add your own set of sentences into the app. 

Then, I've got the authorization to use a really, really nice ressource from [Aakanee](http://www.aakanee.com/illustrations.html) - The illustrations for language learning. 

I'll add them raw in the application (cut the border to make it mobile friendly) for you to be able to practice with your teacher/friend/language helper - and start to add some games to it. No precise plan yet, but feel free to give idea of what you want to see.
