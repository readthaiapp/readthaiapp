Finally !

One of the **roadmap** thing has been done ;) 

I worked on many things those days which were not in the roadmap but more on the feedback from people. 

We are almost reaching the **1500 sentences** in the app **thanks to you** which sends me content! 

I was very unhappy with the Text-to-speech engine of Google and iOS, some of the word were really mispronounced... and so I change for another Google Text-to-speech engine "kind of". 

Now, instead of using your own Text-to-speech engine, he's going to load an mp3 somewhere over the Internet ;) so no more full **offline capability** :<

It is still a robot, from Google by the way, but with a way more better **quality**! 

You can still switch on the old text-to-speech method if you want to use it without Internet. (On the top right corner, the **settings** icon).

Hope you will like it, feel free to **reach** **us** via the **contact form**/ **reviews**/ **facebook** etc ;)
