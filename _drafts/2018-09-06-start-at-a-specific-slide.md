I'm introducing this month a new feature in the app that many people ask me and that I find also very useful ! 

#### The ability to start from a specific slide

Now in the search (of sentences or words), you can say at which slide you want to start.

It's not the perfect solution because you won't be able to see the sentences/words before ... but technically speaking it's the best I can propose you right now and I still think it answer to the need ;) **(Please give me feedback about that ;) )**

As some of you might have seen, the number of words have doubled !

I will be able to provide the feature to add your own sentences soon (I found a very interesting algorithm to cut your sentences into words + all the words in the database, it will be very easy I hope ^^).
