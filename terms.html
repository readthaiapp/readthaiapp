                By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically
                apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them
                carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or
                modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any
                way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of
                the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into
                other languages, or make derivative versions. The app itself,
                and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other
                intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to

                Johann Baziret is committed to ensuring that the app is as
                useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve
                the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its
                services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge
                you for the app or its services without making it very clear to
                you exactly what you’re paying for.

                The Read Write Speak Thai app stores and processes personal data
                that you have provided to us, in order to provide my Service.
                It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the
                app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or
                root your phone, which is the process of removing software
                restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating
                system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to
                malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s
                security features and it could mean that the Read Write Speak
                Thai app won’t work properly or at all.

                You should be aware that there are certain things that Johann
                Baziret will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of
                the app will require the app to have an active internet
                connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your
                mobile network provider, but Johann Baziret cannot take
                responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if
                you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your
                data allowance left.
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <p>
                If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
                should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
                mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
                be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the
                duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other
                third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
                responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
                charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e.
                region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are
                not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app,
                please be aware that we assume that you have received permission
                from the bill payer for using the app.
              </p>
              <p>
                Along the same lines, Johann Baziret cannot always take
                responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make
                sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery
                and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Johann Baziret
                cannot accept responsibility.
              </p>
              <p>
                With respect to Johann Baziret’s responsibility for your use of
                the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in
                mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and
                correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide
                information to us so that we can make it available to you.
                Johann Baziret accepts no liability for any loss, direct or
                indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this
                functionality of the app.
              </p>
              <p>
                At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
                currently available on Android &amp; iOS – the requirements for
                both systems(and for any additional systems we decide to extend
                the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to
                download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Johann
                Baziret does not promise that it will always update the app so
                that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android &amp;
                iOS version that you have installed on your device. However, you
                promise to always accept updates to the application when offered
                to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may
                terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of
                termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any
                termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these
                terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed)
                delete it from your device.
              </p>
