This is the website of the app **Read Write Speak Thai.**

**Why did I write the application?**

First of all, I like to learn new languages, so every time I’m going to a country which speaks another language than mine, I’m always searching for the most efficient way to learn the language. It was really difficult with Thai because I first learn using the English transcription which does not show the tone and sometimes is wrong (Koh Samui should be more Gaw Samui) . Then I decide to learn to read Thai symbols and I had to unlearn almost everything that I knew. I was very confused by the tone rules difficulty and by the fact that most of the Thai didn’t knew the rules either. After questioning Thai friends, I discover that they are just learning the pattern by heart using tables ( กา ก่า ก้า ก๊า ก๋า ). I tried that way but it’s far from being fun ;)

I start reading the **Manee Mana book**, but I was still stuck with the tone so I start **colorising** the words depending on the tone and it was so much easier for me to read correctly and fast.

Thanks to Manee Mana repetition of words and colours, I was able to learn by heart also the tonal pattern and it was much more fun and useful than learning the tables.

That’s where I decide to apply the technics to every sentences that I had in my notes.

To be able to have my notes on me all the time, I decide to develop a mobile app and start adding some useful feature like the ability to find a set of sentences depending on a word, a category, a tone, a source (book or my personal note). Then the Play button to read the sentence, the ability to copy a sentences and paste it quickly in a chat. The app evolve with my need of it, but also with the need of the people which have download the app. **I’m listening to ideas and when it’s feasible, I’m adding it to the application.**

**Feel free to** [**contact me**](/contact/) **if you have any idea which could improve the app.**
